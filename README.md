Malice's mission is to be a free open source version of VirusTotal that anyone can use at any scale from an independent researcher to a fortune 500 company.

I have been told that every serious information security team designs there own version of this tool.  I want to build one so well designed and easy to use that everyone will stop recreating the wheel and instead use that time sharing intel and plugins with each other.
